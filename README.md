# Fuzzball executor plugin for nextflow

## Current state

> [!NOTE]
> **Work In Progress**. This plugin is not functional yet.

This is not yet a functional nextflow plugin. It contains a skeleton fuzzball project plus
code and templates to automatically generate a modern-ish groovy Fuzzball SDK with the
gradle tooling to integrate the generated code into a build.

## Introduction

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/ ) is a workflow orchestration tool with many
possible executors (local, slurm, aws batch, kubernetes, â€¦). We have at least
one potential client who uses nextflow and nextflow in general is very widely
used in the genomics/bioinformatics space and there are high quality community
maintained standard workflows provided by the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/)
project.

Nextflow can provided needed tools to tasks it executes via a number of
mechanisms including defining runtime containers (various container engines
supported) for each task or using conda environments. The latter is considerd a
last resort.

It would be advantageous if there was a maintainable mechanism for giving
Fuzzball customers access to these pipelines. There are three possible meachanisms
to do so:

1. Run a single-job Fuzzball workflow with nextflow running in local mode as the
   single job parallelizing only within the resources available to the job. This
   would in essence be similar to running this in local mode directly on a local
   system except that it would be easier to scale out. This would require either
   using conda environments to provide dependencies or creating a single
   container for the fuzzball job that includes all the required tools. I
   attempted to do this with conda environments using the
   [nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.18.0/) and it did not work well
   due to frequent conda issues. Likely due to conda not being a well supported
   mechanism for providing dependencies to nextflow pipelines
2. Manual/(semi-)automatic translation of existing pipelines into native
   Fuzzball pipelines. Static translation of an abstract nextfow workflow
   definition with a configuration into a Fuzzfile may be difficult if there is
   dynamic (run-time) modification of the DAG based on the outcome of certain
   jobs. Manual/(semi-)automatic translation may result in high quality pipelines
   but will require ongoing efforts to keep in sync with nf-core
3. Creating a executor plugin that would allow nextflow to natively use fuzzball
   as an execution engine. This is what this repository will in the end
   hopefully implement. Because of the way nextflow likes to handle and track
   jobs this means that individual tasks will probably have to be submitted as
   individual fuzzball workflows (though task arrays for parallelization instead
   of individual workflows should be possible). With this we could benefit from
   all the features of nextflow and could allow customers easy access to
   existing standard tools and workflows. One downside may be that the nextflow
   executor would treat fuzzball like a more common scheduler rather than a
   workflow execution engine in its own right.

## Development

Requirements:
  - java >= 17
  - nextflow >= 25.03.1-edge
   - if using the `launcher.sh` script a clone of the nextflow repo in a sister
      directory. This is awkward and will not support all possible scenarios of
      plugin development
   - **recommended** if not using the `launcher.sh`, you need to install
     nextflow somewhere. I've added some rules to the Makefile to build and
     locally install the plugin for testing/experimentation. See below.
  - groovy if you want to do some local exploration of groovy with the groovy
    console. Otherwise i don't think you need it since it gets pulled in during
    build time as a library.

The repository uses the [openapi generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/). No
install is necessary as the generator script downloads the correct version. The
code generation is based off the stable cluster and uses extensive custom
templates (see the `code-generation` directory). Generated SDK code is _not_
included in the repository. It gets written to the plugin's build directory.
Code generation is triggered during build if necessary. The generator itself
generates a self-contained gradle based project but for the plugin build only
the groovy source files are retained. If you want to manually generate the
groovy SDK you can run

```sh
code-generation/generate --keep /path/to/where/you/want/the/project
```

> [!WARNING]
> There is still an issue with date conversions in the auto-generated API. Working on resolving
> that.

To build the plugin and install it locally to `~/.nextflow/plugins/nf-fuzzball-<VER>` use

```sh
git clone ...
cd nf-fuzzball
make install
```

The repository contains a `nextflow.config` file which will activate the plugin:

```
plugins {
  id 'nf-fuzzball@0.0.1'
}

fuzzball {
  fuzzball_config_file = "~/.config/fuzzball/config.yaml"
}
```

> [!TIP]
> The exact version has to be specified. Otherwise nextflow will try to download the newest
> version which will fail.

The plugin doesn't do anything yet but if you run

```sh
nextflow run hello
```

you will be running nextflow with the plugin activated


```sh
git clone 
```
